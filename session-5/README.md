### Programming exercise: Bioinformatics - Calculating GC content

In molecular biology and genetics, GC-content (guanine-cytosine content) is the percentage of nitrogenous bases on a DNA or RNA molecule that are either guanine or cytosine.

GC ratios have been used to help classify bacteria.

Students will be given the task to read in a genome sequence from a file and calculate the GC content of the sequence and try to identify the genome source.
