  - Grade level and school
  - What did you choose to attend STEM Fusion!?
  - Why did you choose this course for STEM Fusion!?
  - Do you have any experience in computer programming?
  - What do you hope to get out of this course?

### Discussion - How do computers work?
Instructor-led discussion on how computers work.
- storage, retrieval, and processing of data
- computer processes data into information
- data is:
  - collection of raw statistics or facts
  - unorganized
  - does not inherently have meaning
  - does not offer a clear enough picture to make decisions
- information is:
  - offers context to those facts, statistics
  - is organized
  - has purpose due to analysis
  - with context, information can help influence decisions
- define a computer as:
  - an electronic device that stores, retrieves, and processes data.
  - a programmable electronic device that stores, retrieves, and
processes data.
- example - spreadsheet with numbers (spending budget)
- example - website traffic for a given month

### Discussion - What is computer programming?
Instructor-led discussion of what is computer programming.
- mental process of developing a sequence of instructions for a computer
  - emphasis designing and planning (no actual coding)
- physical process is commonly referred to as coding

### Example - Sequence of instructions
Students will be asked to stand up and follow instructions exactly as they are describe on the slide being presented (which are dance instructions for the Macarena).

### Discussion - Why should you learn computer programming?
Instructor-lead discussion on why someone would want to learn computer programming.
- improve your problem-solving skills
- process large amounts of data (finance, manufacturing, healthcare, science)
- create/design a web site/application/game
- to better understand computer programs/technology
- as a career (Glassdoor salary search for Washington D.C. area)
  - Software Developer - $109,099/year
  - Data Scientist - $118,542/year
  - Software Architect - $158,895/year
  - Software Manager – $163,888/year
- as a hobby

### Discussion - What is the impact of computer programming?
Instructor-lead discussion on the societal impacts of computer programming.
- Artificial intelligence/machine learning • Robotics/automation
- Cybersecurity/threats
- Websites/E-commerce
- Payment processing/transactions • Mobile Apps
- Weather modeling
- Global positioning system (GPS)
- Data encryption
- Schedule/inventory management • Social media

### Programming for a Computer
Instructor will describe how a program is translated to machine code for the computer.

### Python
An interpreted high-level programming language released in 1991.
- Can be used for web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting.
- Works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).
- Simple syntax similar to the English language.
  - Syntax – arrangement of words/phrases to create something understandable

### Programming Environment
- A text editor
  - Sublime https://www.sublimetext.com
- A Python interpreter
  - Python 3.11.0 https://www.python.org

### Programming Exercise: Hello World

## Session 2 : Saturday, December 3rd

### Recap
Recap the last session's programming exercise to get students familiar with the process of writing and executing Python code.

### Discussion - Parallel Computing
Instructor-led discussion of high performance and parallel computing.

### Exercise - Puzzles
Students will be broken up in to groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ... to solve a 100 piece puzzle set. This is a timed activity.

Discussion:
- Advantages of working in a larger group?
  - What if you were given more than one puzzle to solve?
- Disadvantages of working in a larger group?
  - What if the puzzle had less pieces than group members?
- Did you need to communicate with others in your group?
- Approaches for solving the puzzle?
  - Introduce the concepts of abstraction and algorithms here.
    - Abstraction - approach can be applied to any puzzle size or design
    - Algorithm - the approach for solving the puzzle

### Arithmetic Operators
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulo (the remainder after division)
- `**` Exponentiation
- `//` Divides abd riybd down to the nearest integer
### Variables and Assignment Operators
- Good examples
  - `minimum_age = 21`
  - `max_occupancy = 500`
  - `work_hours_per_week = 40`
- Bad examples
  - `minimum age = 21`
  - `MAXOCCUPANNCY = 500`
  - `WorkHoursPerWeek = 40`
- `=`
  - Example: `x = 2`
- `+=`
  - Example: `x += 2`
  - Equivalent: `x = x + 2`
- `-=`
  - Example: `x -= 2`
  - Equivalent: `x = x - 2`
- `*=`
  - Example: `x *= 2`
  - Equivalent: `x = x * 2`
- `/=`
  - Example: `x /= 2`
  - Equivalent: `x = x / 2`
### Integer and Floats
- Integer
  - An integer is a whole number (no decimals) that can be positive, negative, or zero.
  - `-1`
  - `0`
  - `1`
- Float
  - A float is a number with a decimal point.
  - `-1.0`
  - `0.0`
  - `1.0`

### Exercise: Integer or Float
- What data type would you use?
  - The number of people that came on your fishing trip
  - Length of a fish you caught, in meters
  - Number of fish caught on a fishing trip
  - Length of time it took to catch the first fish, in hours
  - The amount of fuel to fill up the fishing boat, in gallons
  - The total cost of fuel to fill up the fishing boat, in dollars
