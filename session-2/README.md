# Introduction to Computational Thinking and Programming with Python

## Objective

This course introduces the fundamental building blocks of computational thinking and computer programming using the Python language.

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Improve their problem solving skills
- Write, read, and execute Python code using basic data types and operators

## Materials

A computer lab which should facilitate the following:

- A classroom that can provide each student with access to a computing terminal and Internet access.
- The ability to download and install applications from the Internet.
- A large screen to project the instructor's computing terminal.

## Software

The following applications will be required for the course:

- ATOM Editor https://atom.io
  - (Alternatively) Sublime Editor https://www.sublimetext.com
- Python https://www.python.org/downloads

## Instructor and Mentor
- Sarom Leang, Ph.D. (Instructor)
- Jesse McClandish

## Session 2 : Saturday, December 3rd

### Recap
Recap the last session's programming exercise to get students familiar with the process of writing and executing Python code.

### Discussion - Parallel Computing
Instructor-led discussion of high performance and parallel computing.

### Exercise - Puzzles
Students will be broken up in to groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ... to solve a 100 piece puzzle set. This is a timed activity.

Discussion:
- Advantages of working in a larger group?
  - What if you were given more than one puzzle to solve?
- Disadvantages of working in a larger group?
  - What if the puzzle had less pieces than group members?
- Did you need to communicate with others in your group?
- Approaches for solving the puzzle?
  - Introduce the concepts of abstraction and algorithms here.
    - Abstraction - approach can be applied to any puzzle size or design
    - Algorithm - the approach for solving the puzzle

### Arithmetic Operators
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulo (the remainder after division)
- `**` Exponentiation
- `//` Divides abd riybd down to the nearest integer
### Variables and Assignment Operators
- Good examples
  - `minimum_age = 21`
  - `max_occupancy = 500`
  - `work_hours_per_week = 40`
- Bad examples
  - `minimum age = 21`
  - `MAXOCCUPANNCY = 500`
  - `WorkHoursPerWeek = 40`
- `=`
  - Example: `x = 2`
- `+=`
  - Example: `x += 2`
  - Equivalent: `x = x + 2`
- `-=`
  - Example: `x -= 2`
  - Equivalent: `x = x - 2`
- `*=`
  - Example: `x *= 2`
  - Equivalent: `x = x * 2`
- `/=`
  - Example: `x /= 2`
  - Equivalent: `x = x / 2`
### Integer and Floats
- Integer
  - An integer is a whole number (no decimals) that can be positive, negative, or zero.
  - `-1`
  - `0`
  - `1`
- Float
  - A float is a number with a decimal point.
  - `-1.0`
  - `0.0`
  - `1.0`

### Exercise: Integer or Float
- What data type would you use?
  - The number of people that came on your fishing trip
  - Length of a fish you caught, in meters
  - Number of fish caught on a fishing trip
  - Length of time it took to catch the first fish, in hours
  - The amount of fuel to fill up the fishing boat, in gallons
  - The total cost of fuel to fill up the fishing boat, in dollars
### Exercise: Order of Operations
