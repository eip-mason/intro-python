# Introduction to Computational Thinking and Programming with Python

## Objective

This course introduces the fundamental building blocks of computational thinking and computer programming using the Python language.

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Improve their problem solving skills
- Write, read, and execute Python code using basic data types and operators

## Materials

A computer lab which should facilitate the following:

- A classroom that can provide each student with access to a computing terminal and Internet access.
- The ability to download and install applications from the Internet.
- A large screen to project the instructor's computing terminal.

## Software

The following applications will be required for the course:

- ATOM Editor https://atom.io
  - (Alternatively) Sublime Editor https://www.sublimetext.com
- Python https://www.python.org/downloads

## Instructor and Mentor
- Sarom Leang, Ph.D. (Instructor)
- Jesse McClandish

## Session 1 : Saturday, October 29th

### Introductions
Choose one:
- Everyone has a story. What is yours?
or
- Answer the following questions:
  - Name/Pronouns
  - Grade level and school
  - What did you choose to attend STEM Fusion!?
  - Why did you choose this course for STEM Fusion!?
  - Do you have any experience in computer programming?
  - What do you hope to get out of this course?

### Discussion - How do computers work?
Instructor-led discussion on how computers work.
- storage, retrieval, and processing of data
- computer processes data into information
- data is:
  - collection of raw statistics or facts
  - unorganized
  - does not inherently have meaning
  - does not offer a clear enough picture to make decisions
- information is:
  - offers context to those facts, statistics
  - is organized
  - has purpose due to analysis
  - with context, information can help influence decisions
- define a computer as:
  - an electronic device that stores, retrieves, and processes data.
  - a programmable electronic device that stores, retrieves, and
processes data.
- example - spreadsheet with numbers (spending budget)
- example - website traffic for a given month

### Discussion - What is computer programming?
Instructor-led discussion of what is computer programming.
- mental process of developing a sequence of instructions for a computer
  - emphasis designing and planning (no actual coding)
- physical process is commonly referred to as coding

### Example - Sequence of instructions
Students will be asked to stand up and follow instructions exactly as they are describe on the slide being presented (which are dance instructions for the Macarena).

### Discussion - Why should you learn computer programming?
Instructor-lead discussion on why someone would want to learn computer programming.
- improve your problem-solving skills
- process large amounts of data (finance, manufacturing, healthcare, science)
- create/design a web site/application/game
- to better understand computer programs/technology
- as a career (Glassdoor salary search for Washington D.C. area)
  - Software Developer - $109,099/year
  - Data Scientist - $118,542/year
  - Software Architect - $158,895/year
  - Software Manager – $163,888/year
- as a hobby

### Discussion - What is the impact of computer programming?
Instructor-lead discussion on the societal impacts of computer programming.
- Artificial intelligence/machine learning 
- Robotics/automation
- Cybersecurity/threats
- Websites/E-commerce
- Payment processing/transactions 
- Mobile Apps
- Weather modeling
- Global positioning system (GPS)
- Data encryption
- Schedule/inventory management 
- Social media

### Programming for a Computer
Instructor will describe how a program is translated to machine code for the computer.

### Python
An interpreted high-level programming language released in 1991.
- Can be used for web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting.
- Works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).
- Simple syntax similar to the English language.
  - Syntax – arrangement of words/phrases to create something understandable

### Programming Environment
- A text editor
  - Sublime https://www.sublimetext.com
- A Python interpreter
  - Python 3.11.0 https://www.python.org

### Programming Exercise: Hello World
