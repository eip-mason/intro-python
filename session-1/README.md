    *  Artificial Intellegence
        *  Machine Learning
        *  Deep Learning (neural networks)
    *  Quantum Computing
        *  vs. Traditional Computing

### Programming Environment
*  Python IDE/Shell
*  ATOM editor

### First Programming Exercise: Hello World
*  Open up a blank document in the ATOM editor
*  Type: `print("Hello World!")`
*  Save the file as **hello.py** into your **Documents** folder
*  Open up the command prompt
    1.  Test if python is working: type `python` and hit enter
    2.  If you get an error then: type `set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python34` and hit enter
        *  Note: If a different version of Python is installed then your path will need to reflect this.  Replace `34` with the version that is installed (e.g. Python 3.6 - replace with `36`)
    3.  Repeat Step i.
*  Execute your script:
    *  Switch into the directory containing **hello.py** 
        *  `cd Documents`
    *  Call the python program to interprent and execute your code
        *  `python hello.py`
